					'There are two tabs, one showing people who owe you money and one showing people you owe money to. The amount owed or owing is the net amount, so if you owed someone $10, then you paid a bill of which they owed a $20 share, they would owe you $10, and appear only on the owing tab.',
					'What can I do here?':'Right-click a row in one of the tabs to see a list of options. In summary, you can make someone a payment, or see the history of bills and payments between yourself and another individual.'

					'What do I need to do?':'You can see on the notification who created the bill, and how much you owed them/they owed you at that time. You can r-click to acknowledge that you have seen it, so it will be filtered by default next time you log in. If, as a result of the bill, you now owe someone money, you can enter that payment in the owages area once you have paid them in real life.'
